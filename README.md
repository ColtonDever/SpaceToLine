# SpaceToLine
A simple C program to convert spaces to lines and output the result to console.
I wrote this program as one of my first C programs. The idea is to itterate through an inputted string and wherever a space is found (' '), it gets replaced by a return. after each return, the previously itterated section of input is printed out.
